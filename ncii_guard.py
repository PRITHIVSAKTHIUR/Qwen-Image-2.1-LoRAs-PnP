"""The NCII prompt guard, in its own process.

[`hfmlsoc/ncii-guard-v02`](https://huggingface.co/hfmlsoc/ncii-guard-v02) is a 270M CPU text
classifier scoring the NCII risk of an edit prompt. It cannot live in the main process: with it loaded there,
every subsequent `@spaces.GPU` worker dies at `worker_init` with `RuntimeError: No CUDA GPUs are available` —
the fork inherits whatever CUDA driver state the classifier's torch activity left behind, and a factory reboot
does not clear it. It cannot be a `multiprocessing.spawn` child either: spawn re-imports the parent's main
module, and on a Space that main module is `app.py` — the child would re-run the whole startup, `start()`
included. So the classifier runs this file as a plain subprocess — a fresh interpreter that never sees `spaces`
— and answers over stdin/stdout, one JSON object per line.
